Every TAS-Hub project will come with its own repository. Such a repository ideally comes with an instructive README file and a wiki file. For creating a README, place create a README.md file in the main repository directory. For creating a wiki, please go to the repository website and then click on the "Wiki" tab, where you can start creating a wiki file in (also in markdown as the README.md file). 

We recommend that the README focuses on the software aspects of the main repository while the wiki can provide a larger context. 

# README

On the top of the README, please add the project title and a very brief project description; then refer to the wiki page for more details.

Any software-specifics about the code and how to install or use it come next in the README.

# WIKI

Please provide a more extended project description than in the README. Also please point out any rules for making changes to the repository or how to use various communication channels between team members such as the discussion forum of the relevant team(s).
