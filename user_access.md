We distinguish between three different types of user access: 
1) outside users: are able to clone and read all public repositories but do not see any private repositories; this is the default user access.
2) team leaders:  team leaders lead a particular team within the UKRI TAS-Hub organisation, which means admin access to one or more repositories that they create. 
3) team members: have pushing access for repositories created by the team and (usually) other repositories within the TAS-Hub organisation.


# Team leaders 

If you are the leader of a project in the UKRI TAS-Hub, please contact a person in the contact list (see contact_list.md) with an email entitled "Member Access TAS-Hub@Github". In the email, please detail the following information:

1. username at Github
2. title of the project and a brief description of its purpose
3. members' github usernames

After gaining access to the UKRI-TAS-Hub organisation, you can create your own repositories for your project. To do this, first login to your GitHub account, then go to the organisation (https://github.com/UKRI-TAS-Hub), and then click on the "New" button. For guidelines on setting up the wiki, please see meta_wiki.md

If there are any updates to the members needed, please send an email entitled "Updated Member Access TAS-Hub@Github".

# Team members

Please contact your team leader to request access to the organisation. The team leader can either send an updated member access request or add you manually if he/she has the user access to do so.


# Note on "Teams"

Depending on the demand, we can potentially also use the Teams feature in github to allow more fine user access control, discussion, and other options. Please contact a person in the contact list with an email entitled "Team Creation TAS-Hub@Github" and explain why you would like to use the Teams feature.
