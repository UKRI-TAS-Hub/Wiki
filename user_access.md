We distinguish between four different types of user access: 
1) outside users: are able to clone and read all public repositories but do not see any private repositories; this is the default user access.
2) team leaders:  team leaders lead a particular team within the UKRI TAS-Hub organisation, which means admin access to one or more repositories that they create. 
3) team members: have pushing access for repositories created by the team.


# Team leaders 

If you have are the leader of a project in the UKRI TAS-Hub, please contact a person in the contact list (see contact_list.md) with an email entitled "Member Access TAS-Hub@Github".  In the email, please detail the following information:

1. username at Github
2. title of the project and a brief description of its purpose
3. members' github usernames (optional)

Providing all members in point 3. is not strictly required as team leaders have the authority to add team members themselves.

# Team members

Please contact your team leader to request access to your particular team.
